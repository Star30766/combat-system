Pseudocode
1. Define Character Class:
   - Define a class called Character.
   - Inside the class, define attributes for a character:
     - Name
     - Hit points
     - Hit chance
     - Max damage
     - Armor


2. Character Initialization:
   - Implement an initializer method to set the initial values for the character attributes.
   - Allow customization of these attributes upon character creation.


3. Print Character Stats:
   - Implement a method to print out the statistics of a character.
   - Print the character's name, hit points, hit chance, max damage, and armor.


4. Combat System:
   - Implement a function called fight that simulates combat between two characters.
   - This function should take two Character objects as input parameters.


5. Combat Sequence:
   - Inside the fight function, repeatedly execute combat turns until one character's hit points reach zero or below.
   - In each turn:
     - Determine if the attacking character lands a hit based on their hit chance.
     - If the attack lands:
       - Calculate the damage inflicted by generating a random number within the range of max damage.
       - Subtract the damage from the opponent's hit points, considering their armor.
       - Output the result of the hit, including the damage dealt and the remaining hit points of the opponent.
     - If the attack misses, output a message indicating a miss.
     - Check if the opponent's hit points are zero or below after each attack to determine the winner.


6. User Interaction:
   - Provide a simple user interface to start the combat simulation.
   - Allow the user to customize character attributes or use default values.
   - Output the progress of the combat simulation, including each attack and the final result.
